Hello AI

In this project, there are two approaches to take. 

1. Hardcoded via Python.
   
First, we do (shown below) to create and export the API key:
**setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"  **

Then we install OpenAI:
**pip install openai**

Next, we implement the code shown in _example.py_

Finally, to configure in the terminal, we run:
**python example.py**

2. Integrated into web
   
The _api_key_ in _index.html_ should be replaced with your actual/real one, but due to security measures, it wasn't committed. 
Then open the file in a browser.
Type a question and click Send.
