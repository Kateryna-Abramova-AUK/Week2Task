Hello AI

In this project, there are two approaches to take. 

1. Hardcoded via Python.

    First, we do (shown below) to create and export the API key:

        setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"  

    Then we install OpenAI:

        pip install openai. 

    Next, we implement the code shown in example.py

    Finally, to configure in the terminal, we run:

        python example.py

2. Integrated into web 

    The api_key in index.html should be replaced with your actual/real one, but due to security measures, it wasn't committed. 

    Then open the file in a browser.
    
    Type a question and click Send.
